# Important

- Make complete test/example of player/stats tracking
- Improve type conversion method for event params
- Thorough examples and testing

# Less important

- All events should be threaded, or at least have the option. Does TimedEvent really need to be a separate class?
- BUG: If someone has < or > in their name, it'll be removed by current arg parsing.
- Copying events from app to another would be cool, so you wouldn't have to rewrite things.
- Easy way to store player stats in database
